# Cer-ConvN3Unet
## Brief Description
This repository include a program of an end-to-end and multi-parametric MRI-based pipeline for automated detection and segmentation of cervical cancer with two-stage deep learning.
## How to Execute the Program
To start the program, please follow the instructions step by step.
## User Manual
- Slice 3D MRI images on different sequences to 2D slices, then preprocess and resave them to NIfIT format and JPG/PNG format.
- Utilize the codebase of multi-parametric MRI slices detection module.
- Utilize the codebase of and independent three-channel segmentation module.
- Calculate the evaluation metrics and analyse statistical result.
