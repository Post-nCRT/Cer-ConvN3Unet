## Independent three-channel segmentation module
- This module is built upon the research presented in the paper titled "[A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Medical Image Segmentation]-(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04868.pdf)". 
- The implemented code is based on GitHub at [DebeshJha/2020-CBMS-DoubleU-Net](https://github.com/DebeshJha/2020-CBMS-DoubleU-Net).
- We have adapted and expanded upon it to meet the specific requirements of our implementation.
