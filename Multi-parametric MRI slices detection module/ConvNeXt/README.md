## Multi-parametric MRI slices detection module based on ConvNeXt
- The module is designed based on the paper titled "[A ConvNet for the 2020s](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03545.pdf)".  
- This codebase is built upon the work of [WZMIAOMIAO/deep-learning-for-image-processing](https://github.com/WZMIAOMIAO/deep-learning-for-image-processing/tree/master/pytorch_classification/ConvNeXt). 
- We extend our gratitude to them for providing the foundation upon which our project is based. We have made modifications to suit the requirements of our project. If you are interested in the original project, please feel free to visit for more information.
